<h2 id="route">Route</h2>

<p>Since 2017, there are two routes: <em>"Nice Promenade"</em> (regular route) and <em>"Nice Nord"</em> (just 5 buses from Nice in the morning and 5 buses from Sophia in the evening). Within a given route, all buses follow the same path and pass through all the stops <em>(this was not the case until 2017)</em>.</p>

<p>Important remarks:

<ul>
<li>When the bus is coming, you should wave your hand to make the driver stop.
<li>You are only allowed to enter in Nice and leave in Sophia, or vice versa.
  <b>It is not allowed to travel within Nice, or within Sophia, using line 230. Use local buses for that purpose.</b>
  (The driver will be very annoyed if you try to circumvent this rule and may even not stop.)
<li>When in Sophia, always check if the correct bus is coming, or you may accidentally end up in Nice Nord :)
<li>If you end up in Nice Nord by accident or deliberately, you can either:
  <ol>
    <li>Leave at the first stop in Nice Nord, and take a <a href="https://www.velobleu.org/"><em>Velo Bleu</em></a> (city bike)
    <li>Leave at the first stop in Nice Nord, and take tram line no. 1 to go to the city center (If you're taking Nice Nord deliberately and you're buying a single ticket, ask for <em>correspondance</em> to get a free tram ride)
    <li>Continue until the end, and you'll end up at Gambetta
  </ol>
</ul>


<h2 id="route-map">Route map</h2>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Note that Google Maps by itself (outside of the custom map linked above) does not have all the stops mapped, particularly in Sophia.
The coverage is better on <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/43.6167/7.0515">OpenStreetMaps</a>.</p>


<h2 id="circulation-timetables">Circulation & timetables</h2>

<a href="https://www.departement06.fr/documents/A-votre-service/Deplacements/transports-en-commun/dpt06-transports_230-octobre.pdf">Timetable since October 2017 (PDF)</a>

<p>The 230 bus works all year round from <b>Monday to Friday</b>, except bank holidays.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Peak hours (6h40-9h00 from Nice, 17h-19h from Sophia): a bus every 10 minutes</b></li>
<li>Mid-peak: a bus every 15 minutes</li>
<li>Off-peak: a bus every 30 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>During summer (part of August) and winter (end of December), there are fewer buses <em>(horaires allégés)</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peak hours: a bus every 15 minutes</li>
<li>Mid-peak: a bus every 30 minutes</li>
<li>Off-peak: a bus every 1 hour</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nice Promenade</h3>
<ul>
<li>First/last bus from Nice: 6h40 / 20h30
<li>First/last bus from Sophia: 6h25 / 20h10
</ul>

<h3>Nice Nord</h3>
<ul>
<li>First/last bus from Nice: 6h40 / 8h15
<li>First/last bus from Sophia: 16h50 / 19h15
</ul>

<p>If you need to do Sophia-Nice route outside of those times/dates, you can get from
Sophia to Antibes by Envibus (most of the lines, e.g. line 1 or 100), leave at <em>Pole d'Echanges Antibes (next to gare SNCF)</em> and take a train to Nice (recommended) or bus 200 (long, slow trips, often crowded, but cheap)to Nice.</p>


<h2 id="travel-time-traffic">Travel time and traffic</h2>

<p>Unfortunately the amount of traffic between Nice and Antibes is <em>massive</em>. This leads often to traffic jams and/or accidents. The regular trip time between <em>Nice/Cathedrale Vieille Ville</em> and <em>Gare Routiere Valbonne Sophia Antipolis</em> is ~1h10min in normal days and peak hours, and it can easily reach ~1h30min or more in case of traffic on A8.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In case of an accident, heavy rain, major concert/sporting event etc., expect huge trip delays, and subsequent buses in the opposite direction not coming on time
  <li>On Wednesdays the traffic is sometimes less bad than in the other days (but don't count on it too much), whereas it's typically the worst just after long weekends or holidays
  <li><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@43.617326,7.1023096,11z/data=!5m1!1e1">Check live traffic on Google Maps</a> to see what's going on
</ul>


<h2 id="tickets">Tickets</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Single ticket: 1.50€
  <li>10-trip ticket: 10€
  <li>Monthly ticket: 30€ (20€ if you're &lt;26 y.o.)
  <li>Yearly ticket: 365€
</ul>

<h3>Detailed info on tickets</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can buy <em>single tickets</em> and <em>10-trip tickets</em> in the bus from the driver, but
<b>you should have the exact amount ready upfront.</b> Don't expect to pay with a 20€ note for a single ticket.

<li>When you buy a single ticket, you can ask the driver <em>"avec correspondance".</em>
Then they will give you a free ticket which you can use to make a connection and finish your journey in a tram or a different bus.

<li><b><em>10-trip tickets</em> and <em>monthly tickets</em> (read below) are only valid in the 230 bus.</b> You <em>can not</em> use them in the other buses or trams, and you <em>can not</em> use them to make the connections.</li>

<li>Monthly tickets: since 2018, you can create a personal card and buy the tickets via internet.
  <ol>
    <li>First <a href="https://www.lignesdazur-departement06.com/PublicWebSite/Identification.aspx">create an account</a>.
  Pro-tip: Don't reuse your password from other websites, because they store it in plaintext ;) (as you can learn by doing password reset). You need to provide your address, email, phone and a photo.
    <li>Once logged in, order a new card: click `Commander une carte` in the menu on the right. The card is free.
    <li>You should receive your card by post within ~3-4 days
    <li>Once you received your card, log in and buy a subscription
    <li>After you've paid for the subscription, badge your card in the bus to sync the data.
      (Note: It might take up to 48 hours after your purchase to propagate the data, so you should always renew your contract slightly in advance.)
    <li>The electronic monthly ticket is valid for 30 days <em>from the time of the first validation</em> (i.e. not bound to the calendar month, you can buy it any time)
    <li><b>If you lose your card, just log in to the portal to block it and request a new one in one click</b>
  </ol>
</li>

<li>Alternatively, you can obtain <a href="http://www.nice.fr/fr/transports-et-deplacements/la-carte-azur">Carte Azur</a> that is valid for all buses and trams of Nice/Sophia/Antibes/Monaco and the region. It costs 45€ per month, or 365€ per year.

</ul>


<h2 id="newsletter">Newsletter</h2>

<p>You can (and should!) send an email in French to <a href="mailto:contactazur@keolis.com">contactazur@keolis.com</a> to ask to get
subscribed to a newsletter from the operator of the line. They send emails in case of changes of timetable,
perturbations due to special events, strikes etc.</p>

<h2 id="social-media">Unofficial social media pages</h2>

  <p>You can follow the FB page / FB group to stay informed about traffic, perturbations, lost/found items etc.</p>

  <p>The FB page is lead by one of the users. <em>Note that the users' posts there are not displayed to the other users
  immediately on the wall, only once the admin shares the post. Go to `Community` tab to see all the most recent posts.</em></p>

<li><a href="https://www.pacamobilite.fr/index.asp">Paca Mobilite (previously ceparou06)</a> - useful to find buses around Sophia (although it doesn't work great for all stops, and sometimes suggests to travel around Sophia with 230 bus, which is not allowed)</li>

<h2 id="why">Why this page was created</h2>

<p>Getting info about the 230 line is not easy (particularly when you're new in the region and you don't speak French).

<p>There are just too many entities involved, with a split
responsibility, their names are always changing, their websites are not easy to navigate nor very "googleable",
and the content is disappearing, or they do communication only by email.</p>
<p><em>FYI The entities involved are: Keolis/STCAR - operating the buses, Lignes d'Azur - tickets,
Department des Alpes Maritimes (departement06, previously Conseil General/CG06) - timetables,
Region Sud (previously Region PACA)...</em></p>

<p>The idea is to gather all the info that can be useful to both regular and new passengers
and put it in one place</p>
